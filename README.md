# svg_text_macro_replacer
A project to replace text macros in a svg file

## How to use

* You must set the variables dictionary to the variables you want to replace. 
* Also, you musto to define a custom function to handle the variables behavior.

In this example I used this program to replicate a svg file with 5 tickets, and the custom function I used to increment the ticket number.
